# Foundry Local on Azure Local in disconnected environments overview

You can deploy Foundry Local on Azure Local in disconnected environments by using a deployment model that largely matches connected scenarios. However, several key differences exist when internet connectivity isn't available.

This article explains how disconnected deployments of Foundry Local on Azure Local differ from connected deployments, so you can plan secure, offline model operations.

[!INCLUDE [foundry-local-preview](../includes/foundry-local-preview.md)]

## What changes in disconnected deployments

In disconnected environments, extension availability, certificate management, model artifact sourcing, telemetry behavior, identity, and access flows differ from connected deployments.

* **Extension availability**: Before you can install the Foundry Local Azure Arc extension, you must download and import the Foundry Local expansion pack into the disconnected environment.

* **Model catalog source**: Foundry Local pulls model artifacts from the local `edgeartifacts` container registry. Model expansion packs populate this registry.

* **Certificate management**: The `azure-cert-manager` extension isn't available in disconnected environments. Instead, you must install:
  
  `cert-manager`
  `trust-manager`
  
  These Helm charts and container images are included in the Foundry Local expansion pack.
  
* **Telemetry**: Telemetry isn't transmitted to Microsoft. To collect diagnostics for support, use the `az k8s-extension troubleshoot` command.

* **Authentication**: Authentication doesn't use public Microsoft Entra ID endpoints. Instead, Foundry Local integrates with the Active Directory infrastructure configured in the disconnected Azure Local environment.

* **Authorization**: Authorization uses standard Azure RBAC roles on the Foundry extension resource:

   * `Reader` is for read-only operations, such as listing and getting model catalog entries.
   * `Contributor` is required for control plane write operations (for example `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` for models and deployments) and for data plane inference operations such as `predict` and `chat/completions`.

   This authorization model differs from connected deployments, which typically use roles such as Cognitive Services OpenAI User to grant access to inference endpoints.

## Architecture summary

Foundry Local on Azure Local in disconnected environments uses the same Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster and operator-based control plane as connected deployments. The key difference is that catalog model artifacts and extension components are imported into the disconnected environment through locally installed expansion packs, rather than pulled from internet-connected registries.

At a high level:

- The **Kubernetes inference operator** watches cluster state and reconciles model resources, as in connected deployments.
- You define **Model** and **ModelDeployment** resources as the declarative units for model metadata and runtime intent.
- For catalog models, a **cache job** pulls model artifacts from the local **EdgeArtifacts container registry** instead of fetching from the Foundry cloud catalog. You populate this registry by importing Foundry model expansion packs before installation.
- You can pull **BYO models** from a customer-managed OCI-compatible container registry within the disconnected environment.
- Applications call inference endpoints through internal services or Gateway API routes. Authentication integrates with your local Active Directory infrastructure instead of relying on public Microsoft Entra ID endpoints.

The following diagram shows how these components work together in a disconnected environment.

Diagram that shows Foundry Local on Azure Local in a disconnected environment. On the left, a customer or developer reaches the cluster through an ingress controller for control-plane and inference traffic. Inside the Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster, the Foundry Local extension contains control-plane APIs, custom resources, an inference operator, and serving pods for ONNX, vLLM, predictive, and chat proxy workloads. At the top right, expansion packs are imported into Azure Local disconnected operations and populate the local EdgeArtifacts container registry. For catalog models, the inference operator triggers a local cache job that pulls model artifacts from EdgeArtifacts and stores them in the local model cache registry before pods load models. A separate BYO path pulls model artifacts from a customer-managed OCI-compatible registry into the same local cache and serving flow. Applications then access inference endpoints through internal services or Gateway API routes, and a MaaS appliance can call the generative chat service path.
